This is a RESTful restaurant rating micro webapp built with Express, Node.js MongoDB, and Backbone.js that provides CRUD services.

You with me?
-----------------------
You'll need to install node.js and mongodb to start.

Then clone the project and cd into the directory.

	`$ git clone git@github.com:MarsWilliams/PlateRate.git`
	`$ cd PlateRate`

Install development dependecies with npm.

	`$ npm install`

To start the show:
	
	in one terminal

	`$ mongod`

	and in another terminal

	`$ node bin/www`

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have or help with installation.
